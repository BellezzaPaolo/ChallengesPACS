# ChallengesPACS
This repository has been made during the course of Advanced Programming For Scientifical Computing at polimi and contains the solution of the 3 challenges given during the course:
- first one implements the gradient Descent with the Armijo, heavyBall or Nesterov method
- second one is about the implementation of a sparse matrix and the comaprison of the computational costs of every implementation
- third one deals with the solution of a laplacian problem using jacobi methos and MPI to speed up

For further informations there is a readme file in every challenge folder.

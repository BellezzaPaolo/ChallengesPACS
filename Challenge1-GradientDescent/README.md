	computes the minimum of a function with different methods
	to change the method go in:
	-Grad.hpp and change Grad_mode defined variable in line 4 (0 if it's given the exact one, 1 if it's used the finite difference method to compute the gradient)
	-main.cpp and change the method variable M with the preferred strategy
